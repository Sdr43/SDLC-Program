# SDLC-Program

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
If you start at the beginning, it all comes from the Product owner. He gets with customers to listen to their needs and wants for the project they want developed. So, by getting the requirements from the users he then creates "user stories". These stories are turned into individual tasks that are given to the Scrum Team. These tasks are the idea plans of what the customer is looking for in their product. That way it'll be just the way they want it.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The beat approach when developing programs is knowing what method you plan on using. Either a Waterfall or an Agile, Waterfall is just one way and no turning back but, with Agile you have some flexiility and you can make changes when neccessary. Then after you decide on the methodology, user stories will be required to get started. Scrum is by far the best Agile to use, because it's framework is designed to address the main points in software development, which is speed and changes to requirements. This is all completed in phases and a daily scrum meeting is held to go over product progress.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a great team member is working well with others, be able to work independently, be responsible in their role trusting they will get the work done, and the biggest factor of them all is listening to one another by communication. In everything we do around the world, communiaction is the biggest key and core value to anything you may do, no matter what it is.
